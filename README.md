# VetCalendarApp
`VetCalendarApp` is a web service that facilitates the scheduling and management of veterinary appointments.

## Features
The system must allow for:
- Creating a client.
- Creating a patient and linking it to a client.
- Booking an appointment.
- Cancelling an appointment.
- Rescheduling an appointment.
- Managing booking conflicts.
- Viewing the list of available appointment slots.

  ## Local running
  - just start the API project and play with Swagger.
 
  ## Future improvments
  - use more DTOs between layers for more abstraction and hide the domain details.
  - improve code coverage with more tests for at least 80% covered cases
  - handle duplicates recordes when saving data to db.
